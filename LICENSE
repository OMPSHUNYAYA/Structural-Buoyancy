Research and Usage Notice

Shunyaya Structural Buoyancy (SSB) is a deterministic structural governance framework that governs operational trust above classical buoyancy and stability, without modifying:

Archimedes’ principle

hydrostatics

metacentric height (GM)

classical force, geometry, or equilibrium laws

SSB evaluates structural admissibility of reliance, not physical correctness.

SSB introduces lifecycle-aware governance through:

structural posture (m, a, s)

deterministic resistance accumulation

irreversible trust denial when admissibility is exhausted

All classical physics remains exact, valid, and unchanged.
SSB acts above physics, not in place of it.


Intended Scope of Use

SSB is intended for:

naval architecture and marine engineering research

offshore and floating-infrastructure safety analysis

lifecycle and delayed-failure studies

structural governance and safety-engineering research

academic, educational, and conceptual use

SSB is not:

a simulation framework

a probabilistic risk model

a prediction engine

a control system or controller

an optimization or design-automation tool

a certification authority

SSB governs permission, not behavior.


Integrity and Determinism

Structural integrity in SSB is enforced by:

deterministic execution

declared (not tuned) thresholds

monotonic lifecycle accumulation

irreversible denial semantics

reproducibility across runs and machines

Integrity is structural and verifiable, not dependent on licensing restrictions.

Independent implementations may exist.
Only implementations that preserve SSB invariants represent correct behavior.
Behavioral equivalence requires preservation of all SSB invariants.


Relationship to Other Licenses

This license applies to:

the SSB specification

documentation

conceptual, explanatory, and academic materials

Executable scripts, validation tools, datasets, or derived systems may be released under CC BY 4.0 or other open licenses only if explicitly stated.

No implicit relicensing is granted.


Responsibility

Any use of SSB in:

operational decision-making

safety-critical environments

governance or compliance contexts

is undertaken entirely at the user’s own responsibility.

SSB provides structural admissibility discipline,
not authority, prediction, or guarantees.

SSB outputs are advisory and governance-oriented, not executable commands.
